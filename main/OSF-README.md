# Welcome to Anthony Kung's OSF README.md

This README.md is for the OSF event

## Who Am I?

I'm Anthony, an Electrical & Computer Engineer and a Computer Scientist at Oregon State University. I'm looking for internships üòÅ. I love working with ITOps, anything with IT infrastructures actually. I just like to mess around with servers, but I'm also good at DevOps too. I can code in a lot of langages from SystemVerilog Hardware Description Language to C General Purpose Programming Language and I am currently making my own template engine with a markup language.

## What Am I Doing?

I am currently teaching computer science, engineering and astronomy in a summer camp, [KidSpirit @ Oregon State University](https://kidspirit.oregonstate.edu).

## Something Extra

I'm a NREMT student on rotation, you might see me wondering around with an ambulance üòâ and a Red Cross volunteer.
